     <p>
      I'm a 4th-year Engineering Science student at the
      <span class="highlight">
       University of Toronto
      </span>
      , majoring in
      <span class="highlight">
       Robotics Engineering
      </span>
      , double minoring in
      <span class="highlight">
       Engineering Business
      </span>
      and
      <span class="highlight">
       Artificial Intelligence
      </span>
      . While my academic foundation is rooted in robotics, my true passion lies in the intersection of artificial intelligence and finance &mdash; fields I aim to bridge through a career in fintech.
     </p>
     <p>
      I've been a member of project teams like
      <span class="highlight">
       RSX (Robotics for Space Exploration)
      </span>
      and
      <span class="highlight">
       aUToronto
      </span>
      , where I gained hands-on experience solving complex, systems-level problems in robotics. Most recently, I completed a co-op at
      <span class="highlight">
       Smith + Andersen
      </span>
      , an engineering consulting firm, as a Junior Electrical Designer. Despite having no prior background in building systems, I immersed myself in the field &mdash; coordinating directly with architects, contractors, and sales reps, conducting site surveys, producing engineering drawings, and leading pricing reviews. It was a transformative experience that showcased my ability to learn quickly, work cross-functionally, and contribute confidently &mdash; even outside my primary domain of interest.
     </p>
     <p>
      Now, I&rsquo;m focused on pivoting more directly into the fintech space. My fourth-year thesis, supervised by
      <span class="highlight">
       Professor Roy Kwon
      </span>
      , explores the synergy between AI and financial systems. I'm also pursuing this path academically through courses like APS502 (Financial Engineering), ECE368 (Probabilistic Reasoning), and CSC413 (Neural Networks and Deep Learning).
     </p>
     <p>
      Outside of school and work, I&rsquo;m an adventurer at heart. I'm a certified deep-water scuba diver, licensed boater, and sport angler. In February 2025, I traveled to the Gal&aacute;pagos Islands, where I dove with sea turtles, sea lions, and various species of sharks. I&rsquo;m always exploring new hobbies &mdash; this past year, I got into building Gundam models and LEGOs, gardening, fishing, photography, badminton, and golf. I've also been playing the flute for over 10 years, performing with various bands and orchestras&mdash;including the Rosebud Orchestra in Brampton during high school. I&rsquo;m also a passionate foodie who loves cooking for friends and family, researching recipes, and discovering new spots to eat.

              As part of my 16-month co-op term, I joined Smith + Andersen with no prior background 
              in building systems. Despite that, I quickly immersed myself in the role — producing 
              drawings in AutoCAD and Revit, coordinating with architects and contractors, and 
              conducting site surveys to ensure designs were implemented correctly.
            </p>
            <p>
              On the job I learned transformer and panel sizing, reviewed budgets and quotations, 
              and developed a strong sense of how design decisions impact costs, efficiency, and 
              client outcomes. The experience is a clear example of my ability to learn quickly, 
              adapt to new fields, and provide value to the company in a fast and meaningful way.

         This was my first internship in the robotics field, and it gave me a solid introduction to what it’s like working at a startup — fast-moving and full of figuring things out as you go. My main task at Kevares was building a streaming pipeline using Streamlabs, which let us send live camera footage directly to a browser. Near the end of my term, I started planning out a system to automatically detect sidewalk damage from the live feed. I didn’t get to finish it before the internship wrapped up, but the experience got me excited about using robotics and computer vision to solve real-world problems.
        </p>
        <p>
         I was thrown into code early, and while that was intimidating at first, it ended up being a crash course in learning on the fly and writing software that actually mattered. I also started to see how robotics, AI, and web tech could intersect in unexpected ways — something that continues to shape how I think about my career in fintech and automation.

         Pushing carts all day in the heat wasn’t the most glamorous job, but it was real work — tough, physical, and surprisingly rewarding. I learned how to power through long shifts, stay positive even when it was 35°C and humid, thunderstorming or even blizzarding. It truly shifted my perspective and made me appreciate what it means to work hard.
        </p>
        <p>
         The best part was the team - family that I still keep in touch with to this day. We looked out for each other, especially during the crazy rushes or when the weather turned bad. I made some great friends there, and it showed me how much easier hard work feels when you’re in it together.

            <p>
              For my final year, I’m working with Professor Roy Kwon on a thesis that bridges my two big interests: 
              artificial intelligence and finance. The project is still unfolding, but it’s focused on how machine 
              learning can help tackle real problems in financial markets — things like high-frequency trading, 
              predicting trends, and risk management. It’s the kind of work that pulls together everything I’ve been 
              building toward in engineering and business.

          <div class="description">
            <p>
              In this course project, my team and I set out to push the limits of audio generation. 
              We experimented with Test-Time Training (TTT) and a Diffusion Transformer to make long 
              audio clips sound more natural — less repetitive, more coherent. To get there, I had to 
              wrangle over 100,000 audio samples with Python and FFmpeg, cleaning and standardizing 
              everything until it was usable. 
            </p>
            <p>
              The coolest part was seeing our custom model outperform a baseline we compared against, 
              especially under tight memory limits. It was one of those projects where the results felt 
              both technical and creative, which is exactly why I loved it.

          <div class="description">
            <p>
              These labs were where I really started to get my hands dirty with machine learning. 
              I built models like k-Nearest Neighbors for regression and classification, tested out 
              linear and logistic regression with different optimizers, and even trained a neural network 
              on MNIST digits. 
            </p>
            <p>
              It was equal parts trial-and-error and “aha!” moments — especially when I hit 95% accuracy 
              after tweaking and tuning. That feeling of getting something to finally click kept me hooked.

              This was my first real dive into finance. We analyzed Caterpillar Inc. and Deere & Co., 
              combing through financial statements and running ratio analyses to see how they stacked up. 
              On top of that, we built a discounted cash flow model for a $120M nuclear energy project — 
              crunching numbers on things like NPV, IRR, and tax shields. 
            </p>
            <p>
              It was intense, but it showed me how data and models could directly translate into 
              investment decisions. That mix of numbers and strategy is what pushed me closer to fintech.
