     <p>
      I'm a 4th-year Engineering Science student at the
      <span class="highlight">
       University of Toronto
      </span>
      , majoring in
      <span class="highlight">
       Robotics Engineering
      </span>
      , double minoring in
      <span class="highlight">
       Engineering Business
      </span>
      and
      <span class="highlight">
       Artificial Intelligence
      </span>
      . While my academic foundation is rooted in robotics, my true passion lies in the intersection of artificial intelligence and finance &mdash; fields I aim to bridge through a career in fintech.
     </p>
     <p>
      I've been a member of project teams like
      <span class="highlight">
       RSX (Robotics for Space Exploration)
      </span>
      and
      <span class="highlight">
       AutoToronto
      </span>
      , where I gained hands-on experience solving complex, systems-level problems in robotics. Most recently, I completed a co-op at
      <span class="highlight">
       Smith + Andersen
      </span>
      , an engineering consulting firm, as a Junior Electrical Designer. Despite having no prior background in building systems, I immersed myself in the field &mdash; coordinating directly with architects, contractors, and sales reps, conducting site surveys, producing engineering drawings, and leading pricing reviews. It was a transformative experience that showcased my ability to learn quickly, work cross-functionally, and contribute confidently &mdash; even outside my primary domain of interest.
     </p>
     <p>
      Now, I&rsquo;m focused on pivoting more directly into the fintech space. My fourth-year thesis, supervised by
      <span class="highlight">
       Professor Roy Kwon
      </span>
      , explores the synergy between AI and financial systems. I'm also pursuing this path academically through courses like APS502 (Financial Engineering), ECE368 (Probabilistic Reasoning), and CSC413 (Neural Networks and Deep Learning).
     </p>
     <p>
      Outside of school and work, I&rsquo;m an adventurer at heart. I'm a certified deep-water scuba diver, licensed boater, and sport angler. In February 2025, I traveled to the Gal&aacute;pagos Islands, where I dove with sea turtles, sea lions, and various species of sharks. I&rsquo;m always exploring new hobbies &mdash; this past year, I got into building Gundam models and LEGOs, gardening, fishing, photography, badminton, and golf. I've also been playing the flute for over 10 years, performing with various bands and orchestras&mdash;including the Rosebud Orchestra in Brampton during high school. I&rsquo;m also a passionate foodie who loves cooking for friends and family, researching recipes, and discovering new spots to eat.
